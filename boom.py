This module contents the definition of the class cadena. Objets belonging to
this class are models of boom for oil spill recovery.
The module contains also different version of the function employed to
calculate the strains on the elements (links) of the boom. Each version is
apropiated for a different escenario. See below for more details
 
Descriptions for class and class procedures and functions
are included beneath its declaration

    '''
    Constructor: 
    
    1. __init__(self,n=10,cable = np.zeros(3),Anch=[0,0]): 
        It builds an instance of the class. It can be called  without any
        parameter at all.
        n ->    is the number of links of the boom. If n is omitted during the 
                call, its default values is 10. The size of the computational
                 problem is related with the number of links of the boom, so 
                large booms(n>25) employs diferent procedures to calculate  
                the strains on the boon (see below)
        Cable ->  is an nparray with three values which represent the lenght in
                  meters of the towing cables attached to the boom tips and
                  their elasticity that it is suppose equal for both cables
                  [left, right,k]. If this parameter is omitted, it will take 
                  a 0 value for both tips. This means that the towing forces 
                  are directly applied to boom tips or/and that the towing 
                  ships are directly hitched to the boom. Please notice also 
                  that this will have and influence in the procedure use to 
                  calculate strains on the boom. (See below)
        Anch -> Contains values to anchor one of the tips of the boom to the 
                Dock: Anch =[1,0] means left tip in anchored Anch = [0,1]
                means right tip is anchored Anch = [1,1] means both tips are 
                anchores (this last situation can be use to represent a
                static boom and study the effect of streams, etc, but at 
                present this posibility is not implemented...)
            
        The remaining parameters of the object (boom) are defined by the
        constructor and take defaults values, that can be modified once the
        instance has been created. The rationale behind this is to avoid
        loading the call to the constructor with a lare number of parameters.

       turn related with the scenario the boom is deployed. See smatrix.py
