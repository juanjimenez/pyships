This script performs a test on USV speed set point values.
It obtains the relationships among values of setl (the variable of class 
barco that stablish the USB speed setpoint), USV stationary speed and time
taken by the USV to reach the speed
The USV controller is cut out and the set-point is feed directly to the engine

Reviewed 06.03.2017 Probably there are some paramaters bad scaled the result
are somewhat strange
